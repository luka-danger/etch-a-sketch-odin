## Project 4: Etch-a-Sketch built with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML (The Odin Project)

## Description: 
Welcome to my fourth web development project! This is part of my coursework in The Odin Project, a free, open-source curriculum to learn fullstack web development! 

This project was built in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. This project is designed for the web only, and has not been modified for mobile version at this time. 

The task for this project was to build an Etch-a-Sketch with an interactive UI. I hope you enjoy!
